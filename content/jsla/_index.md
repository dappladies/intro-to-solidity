  <p>In November 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto published a whitepaper titled <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electonic Cash System."</a> This laid the groundwork for the bitcoin protocol and the first blockchain database.</p>

A blockchain is a time-stamped series of immutable record of data that is managed by a cluster of computers not owned by any single entity. Each of these blocks of data are secured and chained to each other using a cryptographic signature. You can think of this block chain as a ledger, which can be shared and accessed by anyone with the appropriate permissions.

# Key Points
- Distributed
- Decentralized
- Immutable
- Transparent

{{% note %}}
- Decentralized: no single one point where a decision is being made
- Distributed: the processing is shared across multiple nodes, but decisions can still be centralized

  <h1>Why does it matter?</h1>

  <aside class="notes">
    “There are 2 billion people who have no bank accounts at all. There are another 4 billion people who have very limited access to banking. ​ Banking without international currencies, banking without international markets, banking without liquidity. Bitcoin isn’t about the 1 billion. Bitcoin is all about the other 6 1/2. The people who are currently cut off from international banking. What do you think happens when you suddenly are able to turn a simple text-messaging phone in the middle of a rural area in Nigeria, connected to a solar panel, into a bank terminal? Into a Western Union remittance terminal? ​Into an international loan-origination system? A stock market? An IPO engine? At first, nothing, but give it a few years.”

# Ethereum

- January 2014- Ethereum white paper released
- A new blockchain with a more general scripting lanuage

In the years following the bitcoin white paper, we have a few exchanges go up, we have a dude spend 10,000 bitcoins on a pizza, Silk Road gives crypto a bad name, Satoshi disappears, we have a few more blockchains pop up, and then, in 2014, 19 year old Vitalik Butern publishes the Ethereum white papers

# Why Ethereum?
- Allows you to build applications that could run globally without any central authority
- Optimized for software developers!

{{% note %}}
Vitalik liked the idea of sending digital currency to one another, but he thought it would be even more useful to send it along with a story. "Sure, I'll send you this 1ETH, but only when you provide me with a document."
